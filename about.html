    <h1>About the Foundation</h1>

    <h2>What We Are</h2>
    <p>The Flow Restoration Foundation is a nonprofit organization focused on restoring ecological integrity, human wellness, and system coherence. We operate at the intersection of science, sustainability, and community service — committed to reviving balance where it has been lost.</p>
    <p>Our work includes regenerative land care, sustainable design, open-access education, and community-aligned research models. We serve people, not markets. We restore ecosystems, not extract from them.</p>

    <h2>Why We Were Formed</h2>
    <p>We were founded in response to a shared realization: that many of today’s challenges — environmental, emotional, and systemic — stem from disconnection. Our mission is to help communities remember and return to natural flow through action, stewardship, and education.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
    <p>We don’t treat isolated symptoms. We work at the root — the structure of flow itself. Our efforts are holistic, practical, and grounded in both research and land-based action. We design systems that harmonize with nature, and our approach is built to evolve through rhythm, not reaction.</p>

    <h2>How We Evolve</h2>
    <p>We move with intention, not urgency. The Flow Restoration Foundation grows in natural phases — beginning with land restoration, community education, and structural readiness. Each new phase builds only when the previous one is aligned.</p>
    <p>Our model is simple: <strong>Restore → Educate → Replicate — in flow.</strong></p>
