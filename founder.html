    <h1>James Neil Elliott III</h1>

    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>My name is <strong>James Neil Elliott III</strong>, and I founded the Flow Restoration Foundation to realign systems — not in theory, but in practice.</p>
    <p>I’m a builder, designer, and self-trained systems thinker. My learning didn’t come from institutions. It came from survival, curiosity, and necessity. From analyzing broken environments. From living in the disconnect and choosing to engineer a different answer.</p>

    <h2>What Sparked This</h2>
    <p>The Foundation emerged from a pattern I could no longer ignore: fragmentation. Everywhere I looked — in cities, communities, calendars, or governments — there was disconnection. Rather than attack the problems head-on, I started tracing them backward. What would it take to restore flow, not just function?</p>

    <h2>Hands-On Experience</h2>
    <p>For over five years, I’ve worked at the boundary between breakdown and breakthrough.</p>
    <p>During the day, I supported my father and grandfather with construction, repairs, and practical problem-solving — learning through hands-on responsibility. At night, I began building systems of my own: starting with my first independently developed game at 18, and expanding into models that blend energy, time, and regenerative design.</p>
    <p>I’ve reverse-engineered solutions without funding, created prototypes from discarded materials, and studied flow dynamics far beyond the classroom — guided not by institutions, but by necessity and pattern recognition.</p>
    <p>These weren’t hobbies. They were blueprints for survival and coherence.</p>
    <p>Everything I’ve created came from lived experience — tested in isolation, refined in flow. That’s the commitment I bring to this Foundation.</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>An Invitation to Align</h2>
    <p>This isn’t about hype. It’s about rhythm, timing, and structural truth. I’m not looking for followers. I’m looking for aligned contributors — donors, land stewards, educators, and partners who feel the signal behind this mission and are ready to move in resonance.</p>
    <p>If you’ve read this far, you might already be one of them.</p>
