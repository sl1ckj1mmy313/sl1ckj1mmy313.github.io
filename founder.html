    <h1>James Neil Elliott III</h1>

    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>My name is <strong>James Neil Elliott III</strong>, and I founded the Flow Restoration Foundation to realign systems — not in theory, but in practice.</p>
    <p>I’m a builder, designer, and self-trained systems thinker. My learning didn’t come from institutions. It came from survival, curiosity, and necessity. From analyzing broken environments. From living in the disconnect and choosing to engineer a different answer.</p>

    <h2>What Sparked This</h2>
    <p>The Foundation emerged from a pattern I could no longer ignore: fragmentation. Everywhere I looked — in cities, communities, calendars, or governments — there was disconnection. Rather than attack the problems head-on, I started tracing them backward. What would it take to restore flow, not just function?</p>

    <h2>Hands-On Experience</h2>
    <p>Before launching the Foundation, I worked at the boundary between breakdown and breakthrough. I’ve rebuilt small environments, developed system prototypes from discarded materials, and conducted long-form, independent studies into time perception, flow dynamics, and regenerative logic.</p>
    <p>My projects weren’t funded — they were necessary. They weren’t inspired by trends — they were born from years of watching systems fail the people inside them. I bring that same commitment and iterative proof-building to the Foundation today.</p>

    <h2>Public Contributions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/sl1ckj1mmy313/tft-may2025/releases" target="_blank">Transcendent Flow Theory (TFT)</a> – A foundational model for systemic balance and flow-aligned design.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/sl1ckj1mmy313/chronos-time-may2025/releases" target="_blank">Chronos Time System</a> – A sustainable, quantum-stable timekeeping structure aligned with nature.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>An Invitation to Align</h2>
    <p>This isn’t about hype. It’s about rhythm, timing, and structural truth. I’m not looking for followers. I’m looking for aligned contributors — donors, land stewards, educators, and partners who feel the signal behind this mission and are ready to move in resonance.</p>
    <p>If you’ve read this far, you might already be one of them.</p>
