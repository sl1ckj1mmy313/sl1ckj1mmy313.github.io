    <h1>The Flow Renewal Project</h1>

    <div class="paper-card">
      <h2>🌍 Current Focus: Land & Flow Restoration</h2>
      <p>We begin with the land — because all systems start with the ground they’re built on.</p>
      <p>Our current focus is identifying and securing regenerative land zones across underserved or energetically significant regions. Each site becomes a proving ground for ecosystem healing, sustainable practices, and flow-informed design.</p>
      <p>We’re not just planting trees. We’re restoring rhythm. We treat land not as property, but as living structure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paper-card">
      <h2>🕊️ Coming Phases: Stewardship & Sanctuary</h2>
      <p>Once land is secured, our next phases include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Steward training models</li>
        <li>Minimal-impact microstructure templates</li>
        <li>Flow-integrated sanctuary sites for learning, healing, and demonstration</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These aren’t commercial developments. They’re re-tuned spaces — calibrated to promote coherence between nature, people, and system design.</p>
      <p>All protocols are built to be open-source and replicable. Each sanctuary becomes a signal point — not a silo.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paper-card">
      <h2>💸 What Grant Support Enables</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Legal and zoning frameworks for regenerative use</li>
        <li>First-phase land restoration and access pathways</li>
        <li>Educational interface and stewardship protocols</li>
        <li>Open-access publication of findings and models</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We operate lean. Every contribution directly supports materials, structure, and people working in flow. This is not theory-seeking funding. This is <strong>action-stage restoration</strong>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paper-card">
      <h2>🔬 Scientific Integration</h2>
      <p>Each initiative we deploy is grounded in a research-backed methodology — integrating principles from physics, ecological systems, and information flow.</p>
      <p>We document all processes, maintain replicable restoration protocols, and are preparing data-backed publications that align with scientific best practices.</p>
      <p>While our frameworks are original, they are designed for compatibility with scientific review, interdisciplinary research, and open-access publication.</p>
      <p>Our goal is not just restoration — but measurable regeneration.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paper-card">
      <h2>🌌 Philosophy of Flow</h2>
      <p>All our actions derive from a singular principle: <strong>when systems flow, they heal</strong>.</p>
      <p>We don’t intervene randomly. We restore conditions where balance becomes self-reinforcing. Every initiative — whether physical, educational, or systemic — is aligned with the energy dynamics described in Transcendent Flow Theory.</p>
      <p>We don’t scale by force. We flow by resonance.</p>
